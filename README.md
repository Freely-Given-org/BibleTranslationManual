# Bible Translation Manual

This is a copy of the unfoldingWord® Translation Academy from [Door43](https://git.door43.org/unfoldingWord/en_ta/) under the same CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence.

## Reasons for the copy

These are the main reasons for making this copy (not necessarily in priority order):

1. The ability to rename it __and to give it greater exposure__. _Translation Academy_ is a nice brand name, and hopefully translators are more likely to search for terms like “Bible Translation Manual”.
2. The ability for others to fork it on GitHub. _Translation Academy can only be directly forked on [Door43](https://git.door43.org).
3. Just an easy way to list and curate quality Bible resources here in this home.

## Future plans

Freely-Given.org plans to offer other formats within this same repository, including LibreOffice files and PDFs.

## Acknowlegements

Translations of the original English manual can be found [here](https://git.door43.org/catalog). Freely-Given.org does not plan to include translations here. If you wish to translate it into your language, we recommend that you follow the original unfoldingWord® instructions replicated below for working on Door43.

unfoldingWord is a registered trademark of [unfoldingWord](https://www.unfoldingword.org/). Freely-Given.org is very grateful for the high-quality work done by unfoldingWord, and for gifting it for the whole world to use under a generous open license.

This copy was first made on 12 April 2022 and was last updated 12 April 2022.

# unfoldingWord® Translation Academy

## Description

[unfoldingWord® Translation Academy](https://www.unfoldingword.org/uta) (UTA) is a modular handbook that provides a condensed explanation of Bible translation and checking principles that the global church has implicitly affirmed define trustworthy translations. It enables translators to learn how to create trustworthy translations of the Bible in their own language.

## Downloading

If you want to download unfoldingWord® Translation Academy to use, go here: [https://www.unfoldingword.org/uta](https://www.unfoldingword.org/uta). UTA is also included in [tS](https://ufw.io/ts) and [tC](https://ufw.io/tc).

## Improving UTA

Please use the [issue queue](https://git.door43.org/unfoldingWord/en_ta/issues) to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.

If you want to make your suggested changes then you may use the online editor to do so. See the [protected branch workflow](https://forum.ccbt.bible/t/protected-branch-workflow/76) document for step by step instructions.

## Structure

UTA is written in a simple Markdown format and organized according to the [Resource Container Manual](https://resource-container.readthedocs.io/en/latest/container_types.html#manual-man) type. See that link for more information but here is a quick summary.

Each manual has its own directory in this repository (for example, the Checking Manual is in the [checking](https://git.door43.org/unfoldingWord/en_ta/src/branch/master/checking) directory). Each module has its own directory inside of these manual directories. Inside each of these are three files:

* `01.md` — This is the main body of the module
* `sub-title.md` — This file contains the question that the module is intended to answer.
* `title.md` — This contains the title of the module

There are also YAML formatted files in each manual’s directory. The `toc.yaml` file is for encoding the Table of Contents and the `config.yaml` file is for encoding dependencies between the modules.

### UTA Translation Philosophy

To learn the philosophy of how to translate the UTA please see the [Translate unfoldingWord® Translation Academy](https://gl-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gl_translation.html#translating-translationacademy) article in the [Gateway Language Manual](https://gl-manual.readthedocs.io/).

NOTE: The Bible was originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. In these languages, masculine pronouns and terms can apply to both men and women. The same is true in English, and in this manual we often use masculine terms to refer to both men and women. For example, in this manual we often use masculine pronouns to refer to people like you (and other translators) who will use this manual. But we do not intend to say that only men can use this manual or to say that only men can translate the Bible. We are simply using masculine terms to refer to both men and women.

If you are translating online, please fork the [Door43-Catalog/en_ta](https://git.door43.org/Door43-Catalog/en_ta) repository, following this workflow: [Translate Content Online](https://forum.ccbt.bible/t/translate-content-online/75).

### Technical Information for Translating UTA

* *Do not* rename any files or directories. Only translate what is inside the files.
* The `config.yaml` and `toc.yaml` files do not need to be changed unless you add a new module. When you are finished translating, you may want to update the `title` fields in the `toc.yaml` file, but you shouldn’t make any other changes in those files.
* Images that are included in UTA should be no more than 600px wide. NOTE: If you use the images already in UTA, you do not need to translate the names of the image files. They will work in their current format.
* Hyperlinks (links to other articles or to other pages on the internet) follow this pattern: `[text to display](https://www.example.com)`. You can translate the “text to display” inside the square brackets but not the web address that follows inside the parentheses.

You are free to add additional modules. In order for the new modules to be included, all of the following conditions need to be satisfied:

* You must create a directory in one of the manual directories (like the translate directory) that has the short name of the module you want to write. For example, to create a new module on “testing” in the Translation Manual, you will want to put the file in “translate/testing/01.md.”
* The file must be included in the table of contents, `toc.yaml` for the appropriate manual.
* The value of the slug in the `toc.yaml` file and the directory (without the extension) must be the same as the directory name (`testing` in this example).
* The slug must be unique, and not used in any of the other manuals. This is a requirement so that it is possible to create unambiguous links to each module.
