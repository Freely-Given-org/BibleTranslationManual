### How to Translate

There are two things to do in translation:

1. Discover the meaning in the source language text (See [Discover the Meaning of the Text](../translate-discover/01.md).)
1. Re-tell the meaning in the target language translation (See [Re-telling the Meaning](../translate-retell/01.md).)

Instructions for translation sometimes divide these two things into smaller steps. The graphic below shows how these two fit into the translation process.
