### Description

Sometimes there are notes for a phrase and separate notes for portions of that phrase. In that case, the larger phrase is explained first, and its parts afterward.

### Translation Notes Examples

> **But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart** that you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath. (Romans 2:5a ULT)
>
>

* **But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart** — Paul uses a metaphor to compare a person who refuses to obey God to something hard, like a stone. He also uses the metonym “heart” to represent the whole person. Alternate translation: “it is because you refuse to listen and repent” (See: *Metaphor* and *Metonymy*)
* **hardness and unrepentant heart** — The phrase “unrepentant heart” explains the word “hardness” (See: *Doublet*)

In this example the first note explains the metaphor and the metonym in the longer phrase as a whole, and the second note explains the doublet within the longer phrase.
