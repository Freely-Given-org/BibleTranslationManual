### Description

Sometimes a Note suggests a translation from the UST. In that case the text from the UST will be followed by “(UST).”

### Translation Notes Examples

> He who **sits in the heavens** will sneer at them. (Psalms 2:4a **ULT**)

> But the one who **sits on his throne in heaven** laughs at them. (Psalms 2:4a **UST**)

The Note for this verse says:

* **sits in the heavens** — Here, **sitting** represents ruling. What he sits on can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “rules in the heavens” or “sits on his throne in heaven” (UST) (See [Metonymy](../figs-metonymy/01.md))

Here there are two suggested translations for the phrase “sits in the heavens.” The first expresses clearly what “sits in the heavens” represents. The second gives a hint about the idea of ruling by stated clearly that he sits on his “throne.” This suggestion is from the UST.

> And he saw Jesus, **fell on his face**, and begged him. (Luke 5:12b **ULT**)

> When he saw Jesus, **he bowed down to the ground**. (Luke 5:12b **UST**)

The Note for this verse says:

* **he fell on his face** — “he knelt and touched the ground with his face” or “he bowed down to the ground” (UST)

Here the words from the UST are provided as another translation suggestion.
